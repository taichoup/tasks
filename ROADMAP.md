- needs a dev db and a proper dev flow: it should be able to run in prod or dev mode, and not on the same db
- needs some sort of contract between back and front. I did add an OpenAPI thing but am not sure how it works. We need schema validation on the lambda side, too. Look at Request Validator in API Gateway, for every method's method request section. Maybe that's a good lead.
- needs something more robust for CORS, so as not to have to allow *
- add a filter based on tags.
- use Zod for schema validation and typing generation?
